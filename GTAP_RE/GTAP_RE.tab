    HISTORY of GTAPv7 model file
    ----------------------------
    Jun 2017: Version 7.0 (JGEA publication) replaces GTAP.tab version 6.2 
   
    Version 7.1
    -----------
    Nov 2017: Added variables and equations representing tax-inclusive and 
              tax-exclusive real prices for mobile and sluggish endowments
              - pefactreal(e,r)  --> tax-exclusive real factor prices
              - pebfactreal(e,r) --> tax-inclusive real factor prices
    Apr 2018: Refined set definition in Section C-A1 (Allocative efficiency 
              effect: activity, comodity and endowment Summary) 
    Jul 2018: Defined a new set ENDT to distinguish endowment types (mobile, 
              sluggish and fixed) and added an endowment binary flag parameter 
              (ENDOWFLAG) to define endowment sets at run time. 
    Nov 2019: Modified formula for ENDWMSHR  
              - old --> ENDWMSHR(e,a,r) = EVFB(e,a,r) / VENDWM(e,r);
              - new --> ENDWMSHR(e,a,r) = EVOS(e,a,r) / VES(e,r);
              The modified formula uses supply price weights instead of basic
              price weights. This fixes a defect in ENDWMSHR in the classic 
              GTAP v6.2 model (does not show up in the results since factor 
              income taxes were activity-generic). In the GTAPv7 model factor 
              income taxes, tinc(e,a,r), are activity-specific. So factor tax   
              changes in a particular activity, say labor tax in agriculture, 
              would cause reallocation as suppliers of labor would react to the 
              tax change. The old formula results in adding up inconsistency and 
              unintened endowment welfare effects when income taxes are shocked.
    Dec 2019: Modified Section C-A21 and added Section CA25 in the Welfare 
              decomposition module to distinguish between output and income tax 
              effects. This required changes to BOUTAX and BINCTAX formulae, and
              BMAKEBACT replaced by BMAKEB (See Section C: Welfare summary).    
              Also fixed a typo error by renaming Section A3 to A24
              - Section 11.5  --> added element "inctax" in the Set ALLTAX   
              - Section C-A21 --> now only reports output tax effect
        [NEW] - Section C-A25 --> reports factor income tax effect  
    Feb 2020: Added zerodivide statements in share calculations for PMSHR, GMSHR
              and IMSHR to avoid arithmetic errors. This change is associated 
              with reduced smearing (i.e., use of tiny number, typically 1.0e-6 
              in lieu of zeroes) in GTAP Data Base construction.
    Aug 2020: Modified the following:
              - Consistent use of zerodivide statements throughout the code.
              - Corrected formula for coefficient VWOU: now includes VIP(c,r)
              - Updated indices for some coefficients and variables to ensure
                consistent use of "s" for source or exporting regions and
                "d" for destination or importing regions.
              - Corrected E_del_tbary by adding 100 * on the left-hand side
                - old -->  INCOMEWLD * del_tbalry(r)  
                - new -->  INCOMEWLD * 100 * del_tbalry(r) 
              - Re-arranged Section 11 (Welfare measurement and decomposition) 
                for readability. Welfare contribution equations are now arranged
                into sub-sections and ordered in the same way as they appear in 
                E_EV_ALT(r). Some welfare contribution equations were also 
                streamlined to avoid repetitive calculations. For example,                
                - old --> CNTqe(e,r) = [0.01 * EVSCALFACT(r)] * sum{a,ACTS, 
                                         INCTAX(e,a,r) * [qes(e,a,r) - pop(r)]};
                - new --> CNTqe(e,r) = sum{a,ACTS, CNTqea(e,a,r)};
    Jan 2022: Modified the following:
              - Renamed set CTAX to ALLTAX in the welfare decomposition module 
	      	    (Section 11-5)  since this set covers ALL taxes in the economy.  
              - [NEW] World GDP indices (qgdpwld,pgdpwld,vgdpwld) in Section B-3.
    Aug 2023: Added [NEW] aggregate quantity index for private household demand, 
              qpriv(r), and government demand, qgov(r), in Sections 5-1 and 5-2.

    A-1. SET definitions
    --------------------

    Sets define relevant groupings of entities over which we will be performing 
    operations in the model. SUBSETS are defined in order to facilitate 
    summation over only a portion of a given group, e.g., margin commodities.

    The GTAP Model requires separate SET specification for activities and 
    commodities because of multi-production possibilities--i.e., a single 
    activity could produce multiple commodities (e.g., an agriculture activity 
    producing multiple agricultural commodities), or for a commodity to be 
    produced by multiple activities (e.g., electricity being produced by 
    different generation activities).

    Although the standard GTAP Data Base has a diagonal 'make' matrix, it is 
    possible to aggregate it such that the resulting aggregated 
    database would have a non-diagonal 'make' matrix structure.

    A-2. READ Base Data
    -------------------
    We read in here almost all the base data, and define variables and
    coefficients associated with them. A few data arrays, namely: VKB, 
    VTMFSD and DPARSUM are read in their respective modules.

    Data flows and prices are valued at: supplier(S)
                                         basic(B)     
                                         purchaser(P)
                                         FOB exports 
                                         CIF imports

    The READ statements are divided into six sections:
    Firms
    Commodity Supply
    Government Consumption
    Private Consumption
    Investment Consumption
    Saving
    Global Bank
    International Trade and Transport

    Since these are invariant for each solution of the model, they are termed
    coefficients. Coefficients are assigned upper case to distinguish them
    from variables (this is purely cosmetic, as GEMPACK is not case-sensitive). 
    Variables in GEMPACK are assigned lower case labels to denote the fact that 
    they are percentage changes. In some cases, original levels values for 
    selected variables are defined to permit the user to compare post-simulation 
    levels values across several simulations.

    The updating command indicates how the new level of the coefficient will
    be computed based on the previous solution of the linearized equations.
    Note that the notation used in the update commands is a shorthand for
    total differentials of these coefficient values.  Thus, w * v indicates
    that we want to take the total differential of W * V, plug in the
    calculated values of w and v, and add this to the base level in order to
    obtain a revised value for this product.

    ---------------------

    The following picture describes commodity supply and sourcing. On the supply 
    side, activities with multiple outputs are given a CET specification wherein 
    they maximize their total revenue stream subject to being on the constant 
    elasticity of transformation frontier. On the demand side, buyers of a 
    commodity produced by multiple activities wish to minimize the total cost 
    of supply subject to a CES preference function.

    ESUBQ is 1/CES elasticity. ESUBQ=0.0 means that commodity c produced by 2 
    or more activities are perfect substitutes--i.e., each activity receives the 
    same price (i.e., the law of one price holds) for a given commodity. 
    In the equation E_pca below,  pca(c,a,r,t) = pds(c,r,t) if ESUBQ = 0.0  
    But this will not work well if two or more activities each only produce the 
    same good (e.g., CoalElec and NuclearElec each only produce electricity), 
    resulting in structurally singular matrix problems, especially under the 
    standard GTAP closure, where most factors used by these activitiesare 
    perfectly mobile. In such cases, capital could be set as a sluggish 
    factor (note: if ETRAE=-0.000001, capital becomes a sector-specific factor); 
    or alternatively, capital could be perfectfly mobile across sectors but with 
    ESUBQ set to allow for a degree of commodity sourcing differentiation 
    (i.e., commodity c produced by diff activities are imperfect substitutes). 
    For example, ESUBQ could be set to 0.5 giving an elasticity of substitution 
    of 2.0 = 1/ESUBQ = 1/0.5. Alternative values for ESUBQ could be defined by 
    the user in the parameter input file.

    E_qtmfsd equation computes the bilateral demand for international
    transportation services.  It reflects the fact that the demand for
    services along any particular route is proportional to the quantity of
    merchandise shipped [i.e., QXS(c,s,d)].  It is here that we introduce the
    potential for input-augmenting tech change, atmfsd(m,c,s,d), which is
    commodity- and route-specific.  Thus, in the levels:
            ATMFSD(m,c,s,d) * QTMFSD(m,c,s,d) = QXS(c,s,d)
    where QTMFSD is the amount of composite margins services m used along this
    route.  Technological improvements are reflected by atmfsd(c,s,d) > 0, and
    these reduce the margins services required for this c,s,d triplet.  Tech.
    change also dampens the cost of shipping, thereby lowering the CIF price
    implied by a given FOB value (see 6-2-2).

    E_pr equation defines the target price ratio to be attained via the
    variable levy.  This price ratio is the ratio of domestic to average
    imported goods' price.  Note that the way this price ratio is defined, it
    includes intraregional imports as well.  In most applications, regions
    will represent groups of individual countries.  However, in the case of
    the EU, this is problematic, since recent versions of the database have
    incorporated intra-EU trade flows.  Therefore, when aggregated to the EU
    level, the composite import price includes both intra-EU and outside
    imports.  So some modification is needed to handle the EU case.

    RORFLEX is the flexibility of the expected net rate of return on the
    capital stock, in region r, with respect to investment.  If a region's
    capital stock increases by 1%, then it is expected that the net rate of
    return on capital will decline by RORFLEX %.  A larger absolute value for
    this parameter will reduce the tendency of international investment flows

!<
    The following variables could be dropped when converting to levels
    equation for income.  They are only needed for the linearized equation.
    The idea here is to look at the ratio of taxes to income in order to
    preserve homogeneity in prices.  (We could also look at changes in tax
    revenue, but then a uniform price increase would change this variable.)
    Obviously a simple percentage change variable doesn't work, since many
    taxes are initially zero.  The basic logic of this approach is as follows:

    Let R be the ratio of taxes to income: R = T/Y, then:
        dR = d(T/Y) = R(t - y)/100
    multiply through by Y to get:
        YdR = dT - Ty/100
    This ratio change is computed for each tax type and for total taxes.  Then
    the change in tax revenue itself may be computed as:
        dT = YdR + Ty/100
    in order to determine regional income.

# computes % change in price index of primary factors, by region #
(all,r,REG)(all,t,ALLTIME)
    VENDWREG(r,t) * pfactor(r,t) 
        = sum{e,ENDW, sum{a,ACTS, EVFB(e,a,r,t) * peb(e,a,r,t)}};

Variable (orig_level=1.0)(all,t,ALLTIME)
    pfactwld(t) # world price index of primary factors #;

    VENDWWLD(t) # value of primary factors, at basic prices, worldwide #;
Formula (all,t,ALLTIME)
    VENDWWLD(t) = sum{r,REG, VENDWREG(r,t)};

Equation E_rorg 
# computes % change in global price index of primary factors # (all,t,ALLTIME)
    VENDWWLD(t) * pfactwld(t) = sum{r,REG, VENDWREG(r,t) * pfactor(r,t)};
!<  This equation derives the price index of primary factors. Note that this is
    the only instance where an equation name breaks the GTAP model's naming 
    convention (i.e., equation name does directly not relate to variable being 
    derived). This is because PFACTWLD is exogenous as the model's price 
    anchor (numeraire) and thus this equation explains RORG which has no 
    separate equation (which has been dropped due to Walras' law). Note as well 
    that the equation is separated into two. The first E_pfactor defines a 
    regional index for factor prices, and the second defines the global index. 
    By naming this equation E_rorg and because pfactwld is exogenous, we can
    for convenience, use TABmate's automatic closure tool to list down all 
    exogenous and endogenous variable split (i.e., closure) that is consistent 
    with the standard GTAP closure. Using TABmate's automatic closure tool is 
    beneficial especially during model development or extension.

Equation E_walraslack
# Check Walras' Law.  Value of "walraslack" should be zero # (all,t,ALLTIME)
    walras_sup(t) = walras_dem(t) + walraslack(t);
!<
    E_walraslack allows us to verify that Walras' Law holds. The value of 
    walraslack should be zero in any GE simulation. The variable walraslack is 
    endogenous under normal, GE closure.  If the GE links are broken, then  
    walraslack must be swapped with the numeraire, thereby forcing global
    saving to explicitly equal global investment.

    In order to maintain homogeneity in the presence of a fixed trade balance,
    it is useful to have a nominal variable which this is measured against.
    The next equation provides this, and we recommend users fix del_tbalry 
    instead of fixing del_tbal in future simulations.  The strategy is the same 
    one used above for taxes.

    consumption, for use in section 11-3. Section 11-3 calculates private 
    consumption expenditure "ypev" for use in 11-2, and regional income "yev" 
    for use in 11-4, within a shadow demand system for the regional household.  
    Section 11-4 calculates "EV" and "WEV". 

    Section 11-5 provides a decomposition of welfare changes in the model as
    explained in the GTAP model (JGEA) paper.
